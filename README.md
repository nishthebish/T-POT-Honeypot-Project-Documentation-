# T-Pot Honeypot Deployment â€” Google Cloud (GCP)

**Project Owner:** Nishanth Butta  
**Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Stack:** T-Pot (telekom-security/tpotce) Â· Cowrie Â· Elastic Stack Â· Ubuntu 24.04 Â· Google Cloud Platform  

---

## Summary
I deployed T-Pot on Google Cloud to capture and analyze opportunistic internet attacks. The deployment is isolated in a dedicated VPC, logs are shipped to Elastic, and PCAPs are archived for offline analysis. This repository contains the commands I used, sanitized logs and screenshots, and a monthly reporting template.

---

## What I accomplished
- Deployed T-Pot (hive profile) on Ubuntu 24.04 in GCP.
- Configured firewall rules, rotation of PCAPs, and basic log ingestion into Kibana.
- Captured initial telemetry (SSH brute force attempts, HTTP scanners, SMB probes) and produced a first-month findings template.
